This is an alternate printhead for the Greenboy3d Pellet Extruder 
<br>
The goal of this project is to offer an alternate printhead to the original one with a multitude of improvements whith minimal extra parts needed over the kit the extruder comes with.
<br>
Notable improvements are:
<br>
<br>
A removable connector for the pellet hose including a gate to stop the pellet flow.
<br>
A significant improvement of the location of the center of mass(COM) of the printhead to hopefully allow faster printing
<br>
A mounting plate seperate of the main body which makes it significantly easier to create custom mounts and makes it possible to remove the printhead from the printer with minimal disassembly
<br>
Hopefully improved cooling
<br>
It is more compact than the original printhead
<br>
A dedicated mount for a multitude of z probes (still a wip)
<br>
There are also 2 versions, one with the pellet hose on the left and one with it on the right
<br>
<br>
Do keep in mind that this is still a wip. there can be issues, I can make mistakes and my designs are not perfect. If you find an issue or have any Ideas on how to improve this design please message me on discord @alx1234

You will need additional parts to the GB kit, consult the BOM to see what exactly you will need.
<br>
As the motor is by far the heaviest part of the printhead, the COM is located relatively high up. The closer the COM is to the x axis the better it is.
<br>
As a consequence of that the printhead has been moved down compared to the original, meaning you will lose a few centimeters of z travel.
<br>
<br>
The Fans I use as reference are a different model as the ones included with the GB kit, so they do not lign up with the fixtures in the .step files.
<br>
<br>
You need to ause support when printing these parts, I would recommend just using your standard tree support.
<br>
<br>
The main body of the printhead is in direct contact with the extruder barrel, so pla is most likely not sufficient for this part. So use something with better heat resistance like petg or abs at least for that part.
