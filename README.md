This is an alternate printhead for the Greenboy3d Pellet Extruder 
<br>
The goal of this project is to offer an alternate printhead to the original one with a multitude of improvements whith minimal extra parts needed over the kit the extruder comes with.
<br>
Notable improvements are:
<br>
<br>
A removable connector for the pellet hose including a gate to stop the pellet flow.
<br>
A significant improvement of the location of the center of mass(COM) of the printhead to hopefully allow faster printing
<br>
A mounting plate seperate of the main body which makes it significantly easier to create custom mounts and makes it possible to remove the printhead from the printer with minimal disassembly
<br>
Hopefully improved cooling
<br>
It is more compact than the original printhead
<br>
A dedicated mount for a multitude of z probes (still a wip)
<br>
There are also 2 versions, one with the pellet hose on the left and one with it on the right
<br>
<br>
Do keep in mind that this is still a wip. there can be issues, I can make mistakes and my designs are not perfect. If you find an issue or have any Ideas on how to improve this design please message me on discord @alx1234

You will need additional parts to the GB kit, consult the BOM to see what exactly you will need.
<br>
As the motor is by far the heaviest part of the printhead, the COM is located relatively high up. The closer the COM is to the x axis the better it is.
<br>
As a consequence of that the printhead has been moved down compared to the original, meaning you will lose a few centimeters of z travel.
