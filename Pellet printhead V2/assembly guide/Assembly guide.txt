Alx3dp Greenboy Pellet Printhead V2 Assembly guide

Consult the BOM to see what screws you need for which parts

I also added simple pictures as reference for every given step

some pictures might be outdated but the concepts still apply

Step 0.1: You need to press 8 m3x5x4 heat set inserts into the main body, 
	4 on top for the motor mount and 
	2 on each sides in the back for the mounting plate
	You need to press these in with a soldering iron,
	I recommend using a bad tip or cleaning it right after of any plastic residue if it comes in contact with the plastic.
	The heatset inserts should be at least flush height wise and it is no issue if they are pushed in a bit more 
	I also recommend using tweezers or something similar to hold the insert in place when pulling the soldering iron out.

Step 0.2: you should assemble the hotend first before starting the assembly of the printhead. 
	-screw the nozzle into the extruder barrel
	-screw the heating block onto the extruder barrel
		The heating block should be roughly perpendicular to the screw holes in the barrel
	-insert the heater and thermistor into the proper holes and secure them with the grub screws 
	!be careful to not overtighten them!
	if you need to have the grub screws on the bottom to achieve the correct angle of the heating block and the thermistor is too short to reach the grub screw you can carefully remove a bit of insulation fom the thermistor, jsut be careful to not go past the protective metal sleeve 
	-the auger does not have to be inserted yet, jsut be sure to insert it before you mount the motor plate

Step 1: press the hose connector onto the hose adapter 

Step 2: mount the motor plate onto te motor using 4 m3x6 screws. 
	At this point you should decide in which direction you want the motor cables to go.
	I would not recommend having the cables on the seide where the pellet hose connector is, as this makes 

Step 3: push the extruder barrel into the main  body and secure it with the 4 m4 screws.
	The m4 scres can be 8-12mm in length
	make sure that the heating block is turned to the back

Step 4: Mount the Hotend cooling duct onto the main body with 2 m3x6-10 screws
	the older version uses 4 screws for this

Step 5: Mount the the part cooling duct fixture onto the main body with 2 m3x6-10 screws
	You need to access the screws at a angle, so use the ball-end of the allen key

Step 6: mount the hotend fan duct and your chosen z probe fixture with 4 screws, 
	the exact screw lengths are referenced in the BOM under "z probe fixture"

Step 7: Mount the Hotend fan with 2 m3x18 screws to the main body

Step 8: Mount the part cooling fan to the part cooling duct with the 2 printed clips

Step 9: Mount the part cooling duct with the part cooling fan to the part cooling duct fixture using 2 m3x6-10 screws

Step 10: Secure the part cooling fan to the main body with 2 m3x18-25 screws

Step 11: Put the coupler on the shaft of the pellet screw.  
	Afterwards mount the motor with the motor plate to the main body with 4 m3x6-10 screws

Step 12: Tighten the screws on the coupler through the hole for the pellet hose to secure the screw to the motor shaft
	Make sure the pellet screw is seated as far down as possible and not lifted out of the barrel

Step 13: Slide the pellet hose adapter into its slot from the top, afterwards secure it with the top bar

Step 14: Mount the Mounting plate on your printer, the exact screws needed for this depends on 	your printer 
	Consult the BOM under "Mounting plate" to find what exactly you need for your version

Step 15: Mount the Printhead onto the Mounting plate with 4 m3x6-10 screws

Step 16: Screw the pellet hose into the Pellet hose adapter

After this you should be done. If anything is missing or there are any issues with this guide please dm or @ me in the Greenboy3D discord @alx1234
